                So Robertina, what will the response be?

                "Yes, Paulious," Robertina finally whispered, her voice carrying the weight of joy and commitment.
                "I would be honored to spend the rest of my life with you."

            <section class="story-text hide">
                Paulious's eyes lit up, and a surge of happiness rushed through him.
                Rising from his knee, he slid the moonstone ring onto Robertina's finger, sealing their love in a
                promise that sparkled like the stars.

                As if nature itself was rejoicing, the trees swayed with delight, casting playful shadows on the ground.
                The flowers in the glade released their sweetest fragrance, and the nightingale's song grew more
                melodious.
                The mystical creatures of Eldergrove, sensing the joyous occasion, emerged from their hidden abodes to
                witness the union.
            </section>
            <section class="story-text hide">
                Paulious and Robertina, caught up in the magical celebration, danced together in the center of the
                glade.
                Their laughter intertwined with the natural symphony around them, and the forest responded in kind.
                The leaves rustled in rhythm, creating a melody only heard on special occasions.
